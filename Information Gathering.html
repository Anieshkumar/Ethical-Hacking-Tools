    <div class="w-full lg:w-3/4 rounded-lg">
    <p class="bg-gray-300 mb-4 font-semibold">To use the Whois tool, you can either use a web-based Whois lookup service, or use a command-line tool like the 'whois' command in Linux or Windows.
    </p>
    
    <br>
        <p class="mb-4 font-semibold bg-white rounded-lg">To perform a Whois lookup on a domain name or IP address using the command-line tool, open a terminal window and type the following command:</p>
        <pre class="bg-black text-white p-4 rounded-lg"><code>whois example.com</code></pre>
        <p class="mb-4">This will display the registration and contact details for the domain name 'example.com'. You can also use the '-h' option to specify the Whois server to use, if the default server is not suitable for your needs.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>1.Download and install Maltego CE on your computer.</li>
        <li>2.Launch Maltego CE and create a new graph.</li>
        <li>3.Add an entity to the graph, such as a domain or social media profile.</li>
        <li>4.Select the entity and choose a transform from the Transform Hub to run on it. A transform is a pre-built script that queries a data source and retrieves information about the entity.</li>
        <li>5.Wait for the transform to complete and view the results in the graph. Maltego CE will automatically add any new entities and relationships to the graph.</li>
        <li>6.Repeat steps 4 and 5 with other entities in the graph to build a comprehensive view of the target.</li>
