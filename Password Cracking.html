    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 rounded-lg font-serif text-center" id="name">RainbowCrack</h2>
    <p class="mb-4 bg-white rounded-lg">RainbowCrack is a password cracking tool that uses rainbow tables to crack password hashes. Rainbow tables are precomputed tables containing a vast number of possible plaintexts and their corresponding hashes. This allows RainbowCrack to crack password hashes much faster than traditional brute-force methods.</p>
    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 flex flex-col lg:flex-row items-center justify-between">
    <div class="w-full lg:w-3/4 bg-gray-300 rounded-lg">
        <p class="mb-4">To use RainbowCrack, you first need to generate rainbow tables specific to the hash algorithm and character set used by the target system. Once the rainbow tables have been generated, you can use RainbowCrack to crack password hashes by matching the hash to its corresponding plaintext in the precomputed table.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="mb-4">RainbowCrack supports a variety of hash algorithms, including MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and NTLM, and can be run on both Windows and Linux operating systems. However, because RainbowCrack requires a large amount of storage space for its precomputed tables, it may not be practical for all systems.</p>
