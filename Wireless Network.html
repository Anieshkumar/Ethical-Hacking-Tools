    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 flex flex-col lg:flex-row items-center justify-between">
    <div class="w-full lg:w-3/4 bg-gray-300 rounded-lg">
    <p class="mb-4 bg-white rounded-lg">Reaver is a free and open-source tool for testing the security of wireless networks by attempting to recover the WiFi password through a brute-force attack on the WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) PIN. It works by sending a series of PINs to the access point or router until the correct one is found. Reaver is primarily designed to work against WPS-enabled wireless access points and is used to test the strength of WPS PINs.</p>

    </div>
    </div>
    <p class="mb-4 font-semibold">Reaver is a command-line tool and can be used on Linux and Unix operating systems. Here's an example command to run Reaver:</p>
    <pre class="bg-black text-white p-4 rounded-lg"><code>reaver -i wlan0mon -b 00:01:02:03:04:05 -vv    </code></pre>
   
    <p class="mb-4">In this example, "wlan0mon" is the name of the wireless interface, "00:01:02:03:04:05" is the MAC address of the target access point, and "-vv" enables verbose output. The tool then starts brute-forcing the WPS PIN to gain access to the network. It's important to note that Reaver should only be used on networks that you have permission to test.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 rounded-lg font-serif text-center" id="name">Wifite</h2>
    <p class="mb-4 bg-white rounded-lg">Wifite is an open-source tool used for auditing and attacking wireless networks. It is designed to automate wireless network auditing, including cracking of WEP and WPA keys, and features automatic scanning and capturing of WPA handshakes. Wifite uses a combination of different tools, including Aircrack-ng, Reaver, and Pyrit, to perform various wireless attacks.</p>
    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 flex flex-col lg:flex-row items-center justify-between">
        <div class="w-full lg:w-4/5 bg-gray-300 rounded-lg">
            <p class="mb-4">Wifite's usage is straightforward and user-friendly. It has a command-line interface that offers different options to perform attacks. To use Wifite, first, the user needs to ensure that the wireless network interface card is in monitor mode. Once that is done, the user can simply launch Wifite and choose the target network to attack. Wifite will then automatically perform a series of attacks to crack the WEP or WPA key. The user can also choose to attack a specific network using its BSSID.</p>
  <br>  <p class="mb-4">It is important to note that Wifite should only be used on networks that the user has permission to test or audit, as unauthorized use of the tool may be illegal and considered unethical.</p>

        EAPHammer is an open-source toolkit for performing targeted evil twin attacks against WPA2-Enterprise networks. The tool allows an attacker to bypass the mutual authentication process between a client and a server in a WPA2-Enterprise network.</p>
    <div class="container mx-auto px-4 flex flex-col lg:flex-row items-center justify-between">
    <div class="w-full lg:w-3/4 bg-gray-300 rounded-lg">
    <p class="mb-4">The tool works by creating a fake access point that emulates the target network and sends deauthentication packets to the target client, forcing it to disconnect from the legitimate access point and connect to the fake one. EAPHammer then performs a fake EAP authentication process with the target client and captures its credentials.</p><br>
    <p>The usage of EAPHammer involves configuring the tool with the necessary information about the target network, including the EAP method and other network parameters. The tool provides a simple command-line interface for executing the attack and capturing the credentials. It also offers various advanced features such as the ability to automatically scan for available networks, perform target selection, and customize the attack parameters.</p>
